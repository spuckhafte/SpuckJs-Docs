# Setting Up
This section will show you how to setup your project.

## Script Tag
You can easily get started by adding this script tag to your html file.

```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/spuckhafte/SpuckJs@1.0.1/Spuck.js'></script>
<script src="index.js" defer></script>
```
Make sure to `defer` your main script, so that it *loads after* the library.

## NPX
You can use the **npx** command to generate a basic **Counter** project template.
```bash
npx create-spuck-template
```
You need **node js** in your system to use this command.
