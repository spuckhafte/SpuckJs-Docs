# SpuckJs
Welcome to the official SpuckJs documentation

**SpuckJs** is a *new* **JavaScript Library** which lets you create **UI Elements**, just like any other framework.<br/>

## Approach
Here, you create an **instance** (object) of the class **Spuck**.<br/>
The library converts these *pure js* objects into **DOM** elements.<br/>
## Features
You can pass **classes** and **attributes**, bind **events** and do all sorts of basic operations on your objects.<br/>
Moreover, you can define **states** and **effects** for each new object. You can also ***share* states** with *parent, partner or child*  elements ***(doesn't matter)***.<br/>
